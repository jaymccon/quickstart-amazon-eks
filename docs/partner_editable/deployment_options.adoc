This Quick Start provides several deployment options:

* *Deploy Amazon EKS into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components, and then deploys Amazon EKS into this new VPC.
* *Deploy Amazon EKS into an existing VPC*. This option provisions Amazon EKS in your existing AWS infrastructure.
* *Enable an existing EKS cluster for CloudFormation based deployments*. This option will deploy the infrastructure needed to use CloudFormation to manage kubernetes resources in an existing cluster.

Many advanced or optional configuration items must be configured by launching the http://fix/me[advanced configuration stack] before launching one of the above deployment options.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure CIDR blocks, instance types, and Amazon EKS settings, as discussed later in this guide.
