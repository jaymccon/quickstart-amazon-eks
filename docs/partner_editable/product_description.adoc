Using Amazon EKS, you can deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications running on Kubernetes on AWS.

Amazon EKS runs the Kubernetes management infrastructure for you across multiple AWS Availability Zones to eliminate a single point of failure. Amazon EKS is certified Kubernetes-conformant, so you can use existing tooling and plugins from partners and the Kubernetes community. Applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment are fully compatible and can be migrated to Amazon EKS.

This reference deployment provides AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy the Kubernetes control plane, connect worker nodes to the cluster, and configure a bastion host for cluster admin operations. Additionally, the Quick Start deployment provides https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html[custom resources] that enable you to deploy and manage your Kubernetes applications using AWS CloudFormation by declaring Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts directly in AWS CloudFormation templates. The included Cluster Autoscaler and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) storage options are made possible by this mechanism and are discussed in detail in the link:#optional-add-ins[Optional add-ins] section.
